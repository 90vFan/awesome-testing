# Suggested Awesome Lists
- [The Original](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - The awesome list of awesome lists.
- [Falsehoods](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) - A funny and educational list of why nothing in Software Development is ever easy. Think you can store a marriage in a DB?
- [Unicode](https://github.com/jagracey/Awesome-Unicode) - A great resource for learning how unicode works and the issues it can cause.
- [Application Security](https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec) - Incredibly extensive, but you'll find something to fit the bill.
- [Selenium](https://github.com/christian-bromann/awesome-selenium) - Better than searching Google if you know what you want.
- [Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security) - This is mostly focused on Infrastructure, but if you're testing a series of systems, this is very useful.

# Software

## Security
- [BEef](http://beefproject.com/) - Manipulate the browser exploiting any XSS vulns you find.
- [OWASP ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - This intercepting proxy allows you to see all HTTP traffic and manipulate it in real time. Easy to scan, catalog and exploit security issues.

## Quality of Life
- [BareTail](https://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/) - Brings the tail linux command to Windows, coloured lines and REGEX search and loads of other features.
